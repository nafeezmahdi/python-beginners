# In Python, a string is a sequence of characters
# Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

# ---> Python String Concatenation

text = "This is";
name = "Nafeez Mahdi"
fullText = text + " " + name;
length = len(fullText);

print(fullText);
print(length);

# String concatenation means add strings together.
# If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error.
# To get the length of a string, use the len() function.
